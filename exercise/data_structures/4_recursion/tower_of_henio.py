"""Problem Statement
The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle where we have three rods and n unique sized disks. The three rods are - source, destination, and auxiliary as shown in the figure below.
Initally, all the n disks are present on the source rod. The final objective of the puzzle is to move all disks from the source rod to the destination rod using the auxiliary rod.

However, there are some rules applicable to all rods:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can be moved only if it is on the top of a rod.
3. No disk can be placed on the top of a smaller disk.
You will be given the number of disks num_disks as the input parameter. Write a recursive function tower_of_Hanoi() that prints the "move" steps in order to move num_disks number of disks from Source to Destination using the help of Auxiliary rod.

Example Illustration
For example, if you have num_disks = 3, then the disks should be moved as follows:

    1. move disk from source to destination
    2. move disk from source to auxiliary
    3. move disk from destination to auxiliary
    4. move disk from source to destination
    5. move disk from auxiliary to source
    6. move disk from auxiliary to destination
    7. move disk from source to destination
You must print these steps as follows:

            S D
            S A
            D A
            S D
            A S
            A D
            S D
Where S = source, D = destination, A = auxiliary

An example illustration for num_disks = 4 can be visualized in this GIF from wikipedia

The Idea
Assume you are writing a function that accepts the following arguments:

    1. arg1 - number of disks
    2. arg2 - rod A - this rod acts as the source (at the time of calling the function)
    2. arg3 - rod B - this rod acts as the auxiliary
    2. arg4 - rod C - this rod acts as the destination
Follow the steps below:

Given the num_disks disks on the source, along with auxiliary and destination rods

Check if num_disks == 1. This must be the termination condition, therefore use 4_recursion to reach at this moment.
If yes, move disk from source to destination. (Termination condition)

For num_disks > 1, just think of your FIRST set of steps. You want to pick the bottom most disk on the source, to be transferred to the destination. For this reason, you will will perform the steps below:
Step 1: Move num_disks - 1 from source to auxiliary

Step 2: Now you are left with only the largest disk at source. Move the only leftover disk from source to destination

Step 3: You had num_disks - 1 disks available on the auxiliary, as a result of Step 1. Move num_disks - 1 from auxiliary to destination"""
