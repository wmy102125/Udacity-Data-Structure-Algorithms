"""Problem StatementÂ¶
Given a list of integers that contain natural numbers in random order. Write a program to find the longest possible sub sequence of consecutive numbers in the array. Return this subsequence in sorted order.

In other words, you have to return the sorted longest (sub) list of consecutive numbers present anywhere in the given list.

For example, given the list 5, 4, 7, 10, 1, 3, 55, 2, the output should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Note

The solution must take O(n) time. Can you think of using a dictionary here?
If two subsequences are of equal length, return the subsequence whose index of smallest element comes first.
The Idea:
Every element of the given input_list could be a part of some subsequence. Therefore, we need a way (using a dictionary) to keep track if an element has already been visited. Also, store length of a subsequence if it is maximum. For this purpose, we have to check in forward direction, if the (element+1) is available in the given dictionary, in a "while" loop. Similarly, we will check in backward direction for (element-1), in another "while" loop. At last, if we have the smallest element and the length of the longest subsequence, we can return a new list starting from "smallest element" to "smallest element + length".

The steps would be:

Create a dictionary, such that the elements of input_list become the "key", and the corresponding index become the "value" in the dictionary. We are creating a dictionary because the lookup time is considered to be constant in a dictionary.
For each element in the input_list, first mark it as visited in the dictionary

Check in forward direction, if the (element+1) is available. If yes, increment the length of subsequence

Check in backward direction, if the (element-1) is available. If yes, increment the length of subsequence

Keep a track of length of longest subsequence visited so far. For the longest subsequence, store the smallest element (say start_element) and its index as well.

Return a new list starting from start_element to start_element + length."""
