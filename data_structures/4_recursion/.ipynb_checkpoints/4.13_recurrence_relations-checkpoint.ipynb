    "Our `binary_search()` function calls the `binary_search_func()` function. So the time complexity of the function is entirely dependent on the time complexity of the `binary_search_func()`. \n",

    "​\n",

    "In the `binary_search_func()` function, we first check for the base case. If the base case does not return `True`, we calculate the `mid_index` and then compare the element at this `mid_index` with the `target` values. All the operations are independent of the size of the array. Therefore, we can consider all these independent operations as taking a combined time, $k$.\n",
    "​\n",
    "Apart from these constant time operations, we do just one other task. We either make a call on the left-half of the array, or on the right half of the array. By doing so, we are reducing the input size by $n/2$.\n",
