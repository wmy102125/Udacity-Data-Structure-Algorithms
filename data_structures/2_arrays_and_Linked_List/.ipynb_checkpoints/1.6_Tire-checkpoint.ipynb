    "# Trie\n",
    "You've learned about Trees and Binary Search Trees. In this notebook, you'll learn about a new type of Tree called Trie. Before we dive into the details, let's talk about the kind of problem Trie can help with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to build software that provides spell check. This software will only say if the word is valid or not. It doesn't give suggested words. From the knowledge you've already learned, how would you build this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution is to have a hashmap of all known words. It would take $O(1)$ to see if a word exists, but the memory size would be $O(n*m)$, where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word. Let's see how a Trie can help decrease the memory usage while sacrificing a little on performance.\n",
