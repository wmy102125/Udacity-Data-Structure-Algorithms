## Task0

**Description**: The problem involves reading the file records into a list and printing the required records  .

**Approach**: use the csv to read the records into a list and print the required records.

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Algorithm**: 
- **Big O Notation**: $O(1).
- **Justification**: don't need anyother steps ,just take out the element from the array through the indexing.

## Task1
**Description**: The problem involves reading the file records into a list and count the phone numbers and remove dumplicates  .

**Approach**: use the csv to read the records into a list ,loop the list add the phone number to a set while set can automatically remove dumplicates,finally use the len function to count the set size

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Algorithm**: A single loop runs through each element of the list once
- **Big O Notation**: $O(n).
- **Justification**: each element is accessed once,the time complexity is directly proportional to the list size.

## Task2
**Description**: The problem involves reading the file records into a list and find the telephone number which is spent the longest time on the phone
during the period  .

**Approach**: use the csv to read the records into a list ,loop the list equal the duration,find the longest duration row 

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Algorithm**: A single loop runs through each element of the list once
- **Big O Notation**: $O(n).
- **Justification**: each element is accessed once,the time complexity is directly proportional to the list size.

## Task3
**Description**: The problem involves reading the file records into a list 
	1)find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people in Bangalore  .
	2)calculate the total Bangalore's call number and the Bangalore 's receive number,calculate the percentage of the Bangalore 's receive numbers which are called by Bangalore 

**Approach**: use the csv to read the records into a list ,loop the list 
	1) add the area codes and mobile prefixes or Telemarketers' number to a set and then sort the set
	2) count the  Bangalore's call number and the Bangalore 's receive number

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Algorithm**: A single loop runs through each element of the list once
- **Big O Notation**: $O(n).
- **Justification**: each element is accessed once,the time complexity is directly proportional to the list size.


## Task4
**Description**: The problem involves reading the file records into a list and find the telemarket's numbers both in call and receive numbers
**Approach**: use the csv to read the records into a list ,loop the list add the telemarketer's numbers to a set and sorted 

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Algorithm**: A single loop runs through each element of the list once
- **Big O Notation**: $O(n).
- **Justification**: each element is accessed once,the time complexity is directly proportional to the list size.
