    "A doctor is working in an emergency wing at a hospital. When patients come in, a nurse checks their symptoms and based on the severity of the illness, sends them to the doctor. For e.g. a guy who has had an accident is sent before someone who has come with a runny nose. But there is a slight problem. There is only one nurse and only one doctor. In the amount of time nurse takes to check the symptoms, the doctor has to work alone with the patients, hurting their overall productivity. \n",

Your job is to write a small software in which patients will enter their symptoms and will receive a priority number based on their illness.

    "* `insert` - insert an element\n",
    "* `remove` - remove an element\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Other than Binary Search trees, all other popular data structures seemed to have a time complexity of $O(n)$ for both **insertion and removal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary Search Trees seemed like an effective data structure with average case time complexity of $O(\\log(n)$ (or $O(h)$) for both the operations.  However, in the worst case, a Binary Search Tree may not be balanced and instead behave like a linked list. In such a case, the time complexity in terms of height would still be $O(h)$ but because the height of the binary search tree will be equal to the number of elements in the tree, the actual time complexity in terms of **number of elements** $n$ would be $O(n)$.\n",
